If-Else and For Loop


If-else
1)Two numbers are given, print the bigger number, It is given that both numbers can’t be the same.
2)Age of a person is given, print Adult if his/her age is greater than 18, otherwise print Teenager.
3)Take a number in input (ex n) and print the corresponding month to it. Ex: for n=1, print january, n=2, print feburary like this you need to give output. It is given that n will be greater than 0 and less than 13.
4)Ticket Price Calculator: Create a program that asks the user for their age and checks if they qualify for a discounted ticket price (e.g., under 12 and over 65 get discounts), If they are eligible print “YES” else “NO”.

 For Loop
1)Print “India will win the World Cup 2023”, 20 times.
2)Print all Odd numbers from 1 to n, take n as an input from the user.
3)Print all numbers from 1 to n, which is divisible by 4. Take n as an input from the user.




If-else

Problem no.1 - Two numbers are given, print the bigger number, It is given that both numbers can’t be the same.




code starts from here : 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a;
    int b;
    cout<<"Enter First and second number : ";
    cin>>a>>b;
    if(a==b)
    {
        cout<<"Invalid"<<endl;
    }
    else if(a>b)
    {
        cout<<a<<" is the bigger number . "<<endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<b<<" is the bigger number . "<<endl;
    }

}//code end :)



Problem no. 2  - Age of a person is given, print Adult if his/her age is greater than 18, otherwise print Teenager.



code starts from here : 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int age;
    cout<<"Enter your age : "<<endl;
    cin>>age;
    if(age>=18)
    {
        cout<<"Adult"<<endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"Teenager"<<endl;
    }
}//code end :)




Problem no. 3 - Take a number in input (ex n) and print the corresponding month to it. Ex: for n=1, print january, n=2, print feburary like this you need to give output.
It is given that n will be greater than 0 and less than 13.
